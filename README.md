## Introduction
This repository contains my programming assignments for Andrew Ng's Coursera Class. 

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 
Topics include: 

1. **Supervised learning:** parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks.

2. **Unsupervised learning:** clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning. 

3. **Best practices in machine learning:** bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI. 

## Programming Assignments

There were 8 programming exercises for the course covering the following topics:

- [Exercise 1 - Linear Regression](https://github.com/gemaatienza/Machine-Learning-Coursera/tree/master/Programming%20Exercise%201-%20Linear%20Regression)
